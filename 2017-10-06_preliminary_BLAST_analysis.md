#SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

##__Background__

The study *Forensic identification using skin bacterial communities* by Fierer et. al validates data that essentially proposes the ability to biologically ID (BioID) any person based on microbial communities present on their hands.
There is great interest in this field because the skin bacteria is very robust to environmental stressors and can consistentally survive for extended periods at a time, providing temporal stability of forensic data that could essentially track what all has been touched or used by a certain individual.
Additionally, this form of identification is highly variable from person to person and even from regions of skin on a single individual. 
This provides a 'snapshot' an individual to be identified on a multi-dimensional variability which could prevent the issue of mis-identifying someone. If people differ not just by the same region of their skin, but effectively differ across multiple skin points, then you can combine the data from all of those points into a cohesive representation of that individual.
Because these are transferable bacterial communities, then you can also track items not just touched by the individuals with their hands, but basically anything that could brush up against them including clothing.

##__Critera__

There are some criteria for this to be a reproducible method of identification:

1. Bacterial DNA recovered from touched surfaces allows for adequate characterization and comparison of bacterial communities.
2. Skin bacterial communities persist on surfaces for days to weeks.
3. Surfaces that are touched can be effectively linked to individuals by assessing the degree of similarity between the bacterial communities on the object and the skin of the individual who touched the object
